Thankfully this is an extremely basic piece of software to use

Edit the rubhttpd.rb file and change the variable base_path to what you want to serve to the rest of the world on this server.

When you are ready, start a screen or have another way of allowing the process to "background" itself and then run it with administrator priviledges so it starts up a TCPServer on port 80.

You are good to go! Once you're ready for it to finish up, just kill the process.
